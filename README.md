### Whoami

Hey , I'm NxtDaemon (Luke idm either) I mainly work on automation or cybersecurity scripts or just things to make general everyday tasks less trivial
I'm currently working on a couple of different projects but for the most part they will be finished early 2022 due to the fact im kinda focusing on my Cybersec and school studies 
I run a Website [here](https://www.nxtdaemon.xyz) with hosted writeups and what will be a collection of my tools, thats about it to be honest; if you need to contact me there is a contact page on my website + other methods, hope you're all having a good day :)
